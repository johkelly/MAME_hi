  * Packaging notes:
    + A 64 bits build is now available thanks to the work of Felix Arreola
    Rodriguez <fgatuno.123@gmail.com> ! A first build was available since the
    last version (0.129) but I waited this one to test and publish it's great
    work.
    + Bugfix: the sdlmame icon was not configured correctly in the main menu,
    section "games". It was starting /usr/share/games/sdlmame/mame instead of
    /usr/games/sdlmame. So the default configuration file was not used. Thanks
    again Felix to point this out!

sdlmame (0128-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * MAME changelog see : http://mamedev.org/releases/whatsnew_0128.txt
  * Packaging notes :
    + Please note that I have made deep modifications on this package version and
    then the compatibility with the previous one is not guaranteed. So, you are
    strongly advised to "remove" any existing previous version of SDLMAME and
    start with a fresh "install". If not, the "update" will try to rename old
    files and folders so you can choose to delete them later. I have made those
    changes to stick Debian folders convention: all files are now stored in the
    directory "/usr/share/games/sdlmame/" and symlinks are done on various
    folders like "/etc/sdlmame/" and "/usr/games/". ROMs are stored by default
    in the folder "/usr/share/games/sdlmame/roms/".
    + Upstream code modification now maintained in a separate patches list. This
    list is built with quilt in "debian/patches" (source package).

sdlmame (0114-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Stable release version 0.114 (2007-04-05)
  * MAME changelog available at http://mamedev.org/releases/whatsnew_0114.txt :
    "The biggest change since 0.113u4 is the addition of a now-working driver
    for Virtua Racing, thanks to the efforts of Ernesto and El Semi. In addition
    to this news, Derrick also managed to get full discrete sound emulation
    working for Double Play/Extra Inning, and partial sound emulation in Bowling
    Alley and Space Encounters. And as usual a few of the major issues and
    regressions from the 0.114 development cycle have been addressed."
  * Original sources available at http://rbelmont.mameworld.info/?page_id=163 :
    "This includes even more multithreading stability enhancements and a fix to
    YUV scaling."
    NOTE: The WolfMAME patches (wolfxxx.diff and mamerandxxx.diff) do apply
    cleanly to SDLMAME, although I can’t officially support that configuration
    (it’s too much extra support load for me). If you’re on Linux/Mac and want
    to compete on MARP, you might give it a try though. Like this:
    (copy the 2 diffs in to your sdlmame folder)
      % cd sdlmamexxx
      % diff -p1 <mamerandxxx.diff
      % diff -p1 <wolfxxx.diff


    "Includes several SDL-specific fixes, including a better implementation of
    the keymap files."
  * Ubuntu package updates : I have added download of new free roms "Car Polo"
    by Exidy (one of the first color arcade games produced, dating back to 1977)
    and "Robot Bowl", a black & white bowling game by Exidy in 1977 too.

sdlmame (0113-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Stable release version 0.113 (2007-03-05)
  * MAME changelog available at http://mamedev.org/updates/whatsnew_0113.txt :
    "If you haven’t been following the news until recently, be aware that this
    release contains a number of updates to both the input and sound code. The
    sound code in particular bears mentioning because its new behavior has
    tripped up a few people. Sound output is now exclusively controlled by the
    emulation, not by the OS layer. This means that it is very important to have
    accurate timing and throttling. Because of this, the throttling code has
    been rewritten to be more forgiving of 'hiccups' and other anomalies.
    One non-obvious side effect is that if you are running your games with
    -triplebuffer or -waitvsync on a system with a 60Hz video mode (like most
    LCDs have), and you are running a game with a framerate greater than 60fps
    (any of the common older Namco titles will do fine), then you will
    experience sound hiccups unless you enable a little bit of frameskipping,
    either automatic or a frameskip of 1. This is because you are hard-limiting
    the game to run at 60Hz due to your monitor’s refresh, but it needs to
    produce more than 60 frames per second, so you are always running behind the
    emulation.
    On the input front, Derrick Renaud has done a lot of work to try and
    normalize the behavior of analog inputs across the project. He has fixed and
    tweaked quite a number of analog controls in the system. Because of this,
    you may find that you need to throw away your existing calibrations and
    re-calibrate with the new settings. The advantage of the new system is that
    it fixes a number of inaccuracies in the behavior of the controls and allows
    games to have more flexible options when it comes to mapping controls on
    your PC to the controls the game used.
    In addition to these changes there are quite a lot of new unplayable Bemani
    games that have come out of the woodwork over the past week or so, as well
    as an implementation of the long-desired (by pinball guys anyway) BSMT2000
    ADPCM code. For this release I’ve also enclosed some regression testing
    tools I’ve been using for the past few months to help catch problems
    introduced between versions of MAME. Note that there are still a few
    glitches in the system, but I felt it was worth providing the code."
  * Original sources available at http://rbelmont.mameworld.info/?page_id=163 :
    "Includes several SDL-specific fixes, including a better implementation of
    the keymap files."
  * Package updates : No specific changes.

sdlmame (0112u4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Intermediate 0112 update 4 (2007-03-01) !
  * MAME changelog available at http://mamedev.org/updates/whatsnew_0112u4.txt :
    "The sound changes have mostly settled now and this build should be a good
    one to test with. In fact, it would be great to get feedback on how sound
    and throttling are working across a number of systems before we move to a
    0.113 release, which should follow soon. Please give it a try and report
    your bugs to MAME Testers.
    Other significant improvements this time around include some more input port
    fixes from Derrick; discrete sound in Checkmate, again from Derrick; support
    for the T5182 sound MCU from Nicola, Ernesto, and Lord Nightmare, giving
    sound in The Lost Castle in Darkmist, Mustache Boy, and Panic Road; and
    tweaks to many sound cores to make them generate audio at their native
    frequency. Note that this latter change may have some negative performance
    impact, but I didn’t see anything too significant in limited testing."
  * Original sources available at http://rbelmont.mameworld.info/?page_id=163
    "Includes new lower-latency sound code (please read the caution in
    SDLMAME.txt regarding pre-existing ini files), plus a ton of stability fixes
    from mainline."
  * Package updates : No specific changes.

sdlmame (0112u3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Intermediate 0112 update 3 !
  * MAME changelog available at http://mamedev.org/updates/whatsnew_0112u3.txt
    "The biggest change in this release is a significant change to the way sound
    is generated. The previous implementation allowed the OS-specific code to
    control the sound, which ended up having subtle impacts on the consistency of
    the emulation. For example, a user running with one sample rate might get
    different results from a user running at a different sample rate. As of this
    release, the OS-specific code is no longer in control of sound generation at
    all. Instead, the core emulator decides how much sound to generate and hands
    it over 50 times/second to the OS layer. As a result, this change impacts not
    only the internals of the sound system, but also requires us to change the
    way we stream sound in the Windows-specific code (and the SDL code will need
    to be updated as well).
    A side-effect of this change is that it is now very important for the frame
    rate to be as accurate as possible. This means that the behavior of the code
    which throttles MAME down to the proper frame rate is very important. Thus,
    several changes to the way MAME throttles its speed have been implemented.
    Hopefully this will produce more regular frame rates and fewer sound
    glitches. As usual, report any problems to MAME Testers."
  * Original sources available at http://rbelmont.mameworld.info/?page_id=163
    "The latest version is 0.112u3. Includes YUV (Xv/XVideo) scaling, improved
    Linux framebuffer support, and non-US keyboard support (datfile included for
    French AZERTY, other dat files will be accepted). This version includes
    major upheavals throughout both the baseline and SDL specific code, so
    please be prepared to encounter and report bugs if you download it!"
  * Package specific updates : I test if you already have a mame.ini file so a
    new install or update won't overwrite it.

sdlmame (0112u1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to SDLMAME 0.112u1. The source code tree has been
    significantly reorganized. Other exciting news for this release includes
    actual emulation of the Namco 54xx sound chip, which turns out to be a
    Fujitsu MB8844 microcontroller with embedded ROM. This allows the removal of
    samples from Galaga, Bosconian, and Xevious, among others. We also have some
    nice sound core improvements from the hoot development team, some nice new
    input port support, a few new CPS2 keys, and a bunch of fixes for subtly (and
    not-so-subtly) broken drivers due to the Z80 change late in the 0.111 dev
    cycle.
  * On the SDL side, this features even more improved FreeBSD compatibility
